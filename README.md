## Introduction

Predicting student placements is a crucial task for educational institutions aiming to improve their placement rates. This project uses a toy dataset to illustrate the complete machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model deployment.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following columns:
- `CGPA`: Cumulative Grade Point Average
- `IQ`: Intelligence Quotient
- `Placement`: Target variable indicating if the student got placed (1 for Yes, 0 for No)

## Workflow

### 1. Preprocessing and EDA

- **Handling Missing Values:** Check for and handle any missing values.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize the data to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
- **Summary Statistics:** Generate summary statistics to get insights into the data.

### 2. Feature Selection

- **Correlation Analysis:** Analyze the correlation between features and the target variable.
- **Selection of Important Features:** Select features that have a significant impact on the target variable.

### 3. Extract Input and Output Columns

Separate the features (input columns: `CGPA`, `IQ`) and the target variable (`Placement`).

### 4. Train-Test Split

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

### 5. Scaling the Values

Scale the feature values to standardize the data, which can improve the performance of some machine learning algorithms.

### 6. Training the Model

Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.) using the training data.

### 7. Evaluating the Model

- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Plot the confusion matrix to visualize the performance.

### 8. Deploying the Model

The model deployment has not been performed in the code but the .pkl file can be used to do it.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive guide to building a machine learning model for predicting student placements. The workflow covers all essential steps, from data preprocessing to model deployment.
